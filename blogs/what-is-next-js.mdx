Next.js is a popular open-source React-based web application framework that enables developers to build server-rendered React applications with ease. It is built on top of Node.js and offers features such as server-side rendering, automatic code splitting, static site generation, and more.
<br />
Next.js is designed to simplify the process of building complex applications by providing a rich set of tools and conventions. It allows developers to focus on building features and components without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
<br />
<h2 className="mdx-heading"> Some of the key features of Next.js include:</h2>
<ul className="mdx-bullet-list">
  <li>
    **Server-side rendering:** Next.js enables server-side rendering out of the box, which means that pages are pre-rendered on the server and then sent to the client. This improves performance and provides a better user experience.
  </li>
  <li>
  **Automatic code splitting:** Next.js automatically splits code into smaller chunks, which are loaded only when needed. This reduces the size of initial downloads and speeds up page load times.
  </li>
  <li>
  **Static site generation:** Next.js allows you to generate static sites, which can be deployed to a content delivery network (CDN) for improved performance.
  </li>
  <li>
  **File-based routing:** Next.js uses a file-based routing system, which makes it easy to create and manage routes in your application.
  </li>
  <li>
  **API routes**: Next.js provides an easy way to create serverless API endpoints within your application.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 className="mdx-heading">Next js vs. React js</h2>
<br />
React and Next.js are related but different technologies. React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, while Next.js is a framework for building server-rendered React applications.

<br />
React provides a set of tools and utilities for building component-based UIs. It is designed to be declarative, efficient, and composable. React allows you to build reusable components that can be combined to create complex UIs.
<br />
Next.js, on the other hand, is a framework that builds on top of React and provides additional features such as server-side rendering, static site generation, file-based routing, and more. Next.js makes it easier to build and deploy React applications by providing a structured approach to building pages, managing data fetching, and optimizing performance.
