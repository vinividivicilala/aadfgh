excerpt: About me

Hi, I am **`Jay A. Cabasag`**, a **`Software Engineer`**. I started to work at a corporate company way back year **`2022`** after I obtained my **`Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science`**. Now, I am a web developer with a passion in building innovative and user-friendly websites. For the past months of experience in the industry, I had the opportunity to work with a variety of technologies and platforms.

<h2 className="mdx-sub-heading">How I started programming</h2>
<br />
When I was in my high school days, my main goal in life is to get a degree in Education for me to become a teacher because back then, I really wanted to help the students learn or just teach them everything I know. But it changed when I found a book titled to a certain subject of Web Development, and that is when my curiosity started to kick in. I read the book and found out that creating websites is interesting. Anyway, the book is not my own property and just forgot to return it to my current school that time. After finding it interesting, I did get a laptop and tried to work on adding simple website using plain HTML. However, during that time, my strand does not work on codes so I did it as my hobby out of curiosity and wanted to learn how website works further until I started learning about CSS and JavaScript. Basically speaking, JavaScript is my first programming language. I never had put so much thought about which programming language I learned first, but now I know it is when I hooked myself with JavaScript.
<br />
After I graduated in senior high school, this is like the biggest decision I made for my career and the path that I am going to take for the next couple of years of my existence—taking up a degree in Computer Science. I found out that some of my classmates struggle working on with HTML and CSS. There are lot of reasons actually, why do I think twice: some of them mentioned that they just ran out of options and/or just took the Computer Science or what other people may call it as an IT (Information Technology). For sure, you might have thought the same thing that IT and Computer Science are the same. But it is not really the same. On my end, it is like I am playing around because I already know about those things—not all, but enough to know things about HTML, CSS and JavaScript, sufficient knowledge for a first-year Computer Science student.
<br />
During my college days, we have been taught basics of programming using different programming languages like Java, C#, C++ and Python. But it is just basics like adding 2 numbers and get the result. In my case, I tend to do something different and work on real projects using Java to master. I used Java for developing android applications or even desktop applications that are connected to MySQL database. Most of us know MySQL since it is like the database that is being taught to us not to mention its widely used for corporate industry.
<br />
On the last year of my college, I convinced myself that I wanted to work as an Android App Developer but then, this thesis/capstone that we want to work on needs to be a cross-platform. All of my groupmates do not have knowledge in terms of working on IOS, not to mention that we do not have MacOS Laptop and that I only have knowledge with Android App using Java but not with IOS. To solve the problem, we did a little brainstorming and we found a solution, and the only solution we could think of is to place it on the web. So, I decided to research about what is programming language used by Facebook since the thesis we are working on is a social media app, that is the time when I learned about React. It took me like a month to understand the basics of react. It is not really that difficult to learn since it is JavaScript. On my second month of learning the basics of React, I started to build a simple app using it and then, started working on our thesis. It took me like four months to complete the projects and honestly, it was not easy for me. It brought me a lot of stress, sleepless nights, doubts, what ifs and there is also this time when I only sleep for like 2 hours a day straight for 1 week to prepare for our thesis presentation. It is like I am always saying that, I think we should just spend another year of our college. Everything seems to be impossible since I am the only one working on it, both user side and the admin side. The project is the CS Alumni Connect in which you can check on my repository on GitHub or projects section. Fortunately, I was able to complete it and I am definitely proud of myself for not giving up. 
<br />
Fast forward. I graduated last August 25, 2022 and after a week or two, I was able to get two job offers: first, at Vertere Global as a Fullstack Java Developer and second, as a Junior React Engineer at Metromart Technologies Inc. But my will chose the position for Junior React Engineer. Now, I continuously learning a lot from my seniors and co-workers. It may be a remote work at this time, but still the collaboration of the team is great.
<br />
I continue to learn and understand new technologies and even master another programming languages like Java and Golang, which I often use on my side projects especially when I am working on Web Services. I know my journey is still far from what I am aiming, but I believe I can get there in the future.
